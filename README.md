# Battle-Ships-Python
This is a game I programmed using python for my final project in my last year of computer science. It is a battleship lan game using sockets to connect the users.
Due to high school assignment requirments I was forced to use tkinter to draw my game. This taught me the basics of sockets and connecting to users over the internet
and the difference challenges you face. A very fun and interesting project I really enjoyed.

<h1>Battle Ships Python</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a battleship game made in python for my final project in computer science in high school. This game works via lan by having a server application and a client. The server hosts while the clients connect to the server. You can place and rotate your ships in the field and fire away at the enemy to win the game.

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This was my first experience with networking, I used sockets which came with much difficulty especially when using Tkinter as a loop was required and waiting for a response would hang the window. This was solved by using multiple threads to handle the UI and the networking seperately.
