# Battle-Ships-Python
This is a game I programmed using python for my final project in my last year of computer science. It is a battleship lan game using sockets to connect the users.
Due to high school assignment requirments I was forced to use tkinter to draw my game. This taught me the basics of sockets and connecting to users over the internet
and the difference challenges you face. A very fun and interesting project I really enjoyed.
